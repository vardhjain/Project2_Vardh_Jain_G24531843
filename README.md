PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Let P be a set of n points in a 2-dimensional plane. 
A point p belongs to P is a Pareto-optimal if no other point is both above and to the right of p. 
The sorted sequence of Pareto-optimal points describes a top-right staircase with the interior points of P below and to the left oof the staircase. 
We want to compute the staircase. 
Describe a divide and conquer algorithm to compute the staircase of P in O(nlogn) time.

The above repository provides a solution to the given problem statement!

I have uploaded 2 python files and 2 graphs as solution to the give problem. 
The Staircase_and_Compare.py file contains the code/ solution for plotting the comparison between the time complexities of the theoretical and experimental calculations. The image, Graph.png shows the relevant results for the same. 
The Staircase_and_plot.py file contains the code/ solution for plotting the staircase for different values of n. The image F100 shows the plot for n=100.
