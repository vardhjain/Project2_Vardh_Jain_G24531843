PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Let P be a set of n points in a 2-dimensional plane. 
A point p belongs to P is a Pareto-optimal if no other point is both above and to the right of p. 
The sorted sequence of Pareto-optimal points describes a top-right staircase with the interior points of P below and to the left oof the staircase. 
We want to compute the staircase. 
Describe a divide and conquer algorithm to compute the staircase of P in O(nlogn) time.
